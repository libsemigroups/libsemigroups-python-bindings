Semigroups: a Python package
============================


This is a basic package providing python bindings for the `libsemigroups
<https://james-d-mitchell.github.io/libsemigroups/>`_  C++ library.

`libsemigroups
<https://james-d-mitchell.github.io/libsemigroups/>`_ is a C++ library for semigroups and monoids; it is partly based on 
`Algorithms for computing finite semigroups <https://www.irif.fr/~jep/PDF/Rio.pdf>`_, 
`Expository Slides <https://www.irif.fr/~jep/PDF/Exposes/StAndrews.pdf>`_, and 
`Semigroupe 2.01
<https://www.irif.fr/~jep/Logiciels/Semigroupe2.0/semigroupe2.html>`_
